# Overview

This repository is intended as a sandbox for learning the fundamentals of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It makes use of the [Kaggle - Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data) to classify images of dogs and cats.

The example code is derived from following blog posts, and YouTube tutorials provided by [DeepLizard.  Check them out!](https://deeplizard.com/)
